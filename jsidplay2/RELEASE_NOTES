Release Notes:
==============

Default Java version has been changed to Java11 and higher, however java8 can still be used. There are additional executables and shell scripts where "-java8" is part of it's name.
Bugfix: Recordings were too short for RSID tunes (RSID tunes are delayed about 2.5 seconds on reset).

JSIDPlay2 UI version:
Bugfix: Changing sub-tunes was impossible, if favorites playback option had been turned off (which is the default setting).
Bugfix: validation and reporting of wrong filter names has been added
Player menu has a new option for the UI version ("Playlist starts with song 1", default: true). (E.g. Last_Ninja.sid with start song 3 results in: 1,2,(3)..11) instead of (3)..11,1,2.
