Release Notes:
==============

Default SID Model has been changed to MOS8580, because most of new SID music releases require that chip.
Default Java version has been changed to Java11 and higher, however java8 can still be used. There are additional executables and shell scripts where "-java8" is part of it's name.
Bugfix: RSID tune recordings ended too early (RSID tunes are delayed about 2.5 seconds on reset).

JSIDPlay2 UI version:
Bugfix: Changing sub-tunes was impossible, if favorites playback option had been turned off (which is the default setting).
Bugfix: validation and reporting of wrong filter names was missing and has been added
In the Player menu a new option for the UI version has been added ("Playlist starts with song 1", default: true). (E.g. Last_Ninja.sid with start song 3 results in: 1,2,(3)..11) instead of (3)..11,1,2.

ConsolePlayer:
ConsolePlayer can now play or record whole folders, just use a directory as command-line argument. This is to better support batch recordings.
Verbose mode now shows settings and filter names, that are being used
