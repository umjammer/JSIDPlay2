Release Notes:
==============
JSIDPlay2:
New Java requirements: Use Java 17 or newer (Java 11 is NOT supported) or as an alternative Oracle-Java8 (we are still compatible) 
New AArch64/ARM64 distributions added (e.g. for Apple M1), and as usual x64 releases
Tools: Recording tool added for whole collections like HVSC using a configurable number of parallel threads
Emulation: GMod2 cartridge support added (RAM expansion works fine, EEPROM functionality is untested)
C64Jukebox: Theater mode added (random HVSC playback)
C64Jukebox: Text2Speech added (executing external program espeak - https://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
Bugfix: Prevent JSIDPlay2 to hang and scan whole directory tree, if called with a SID as command line argument
Bugfix: Thread safety issues fixed, when several recordings are done in parallel in the same Java virtual machine (e.g. recordingtool.sh)
Bugfix: automated tests repaired
