== Online Demos

All Demos are using VUE3 and Bootstrap5.

. This Demo runs ONline, only, and requires JSIDPlay2 started in server mode and streams content from JSIDPlay2 Server to the browser client using link:https://haendel.ddns.net:8443/static/c64jukebox.vue[RESTful API^]

. ...and this demo runs OFFline directly in the browser using link:https://haendel.ddns.net:8443/static/teavm/c64jukebox.vue?teavmFormat=JS[JavaScript UMD^]

== Introduction

I am a C64 fan since 1986 as many other people are. I played games, watched demos and read books, but when the time goes by, all activities stopped slowly in the beginning of the 90s. 
But one thing from the past i actually do until today, that is listening the precious SID music of all the talented music artists and demo groups. So many thanks to all of you for your work collected in the link:https://www.hvsc.c64.org/[HVSC^].

To listen the new releases from the still active groups i often used link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/sidplay2/[sidplay2^]  for windows or an emulator like link:http://www.ccs64.com/[CCS64^] , because my commodore was on the attic.

I am a Java developer and wanted to have my very own java implementation to create a so called C64 Jukebox. 
I decided to create a 1:1 conversion of link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/sidplay2/[sidplay2^] from C++ to java. It should have all features of the original.
It was a long time work and when it was finished i decided to make it open source, that others can integrate into their java emulators. +
Perhaps there will be plugins for many java apps some day or a version running even on a mobile.

Since then people have joined to develop a more complete C64 emulator to be fast, feature complete and eye-catching. Without them this project would be stuck on version 1.4 and i am very thankful for their help. In fact i hope this project will never die.

The current version has been evolved toward a full featured and very compatible C64 emulator. This was possible due to the tremendous support of the C64 community. In fact many people have supported JSIDPlay2 during its development.

*Special thanks* go to Antti S. Lankila for continued development to enhance the emulation and adding valuable features, Nata for his numerous tests and many feedback of the beta versions, Wilfred Bos for his support and bugfix of the SIDNetDevice implementation. Other people contributed valuable pieces of code just read the Credits in the player to find out. 
Thank you!

== Features

JSidplay2 is able to

* load sound files with extensions: SID (PSID/RSID), MUS, DAT, P00, PRG, STR. You can find most of them in the link:https://www.hvsc.c64.org/[High Voltage SID Collection^], the biggest music collecton on earth. 
* play mono, stereo and 3-SID formats
* play with custom sample rates (sample size is 16 bit)
* load external SID Filter definition
* check song length from Song Length database (SLDb - contained in HVSC)
* be configured by an INI file containing emulation and player settings
* be integrated into Java enabled platforms
* being used like a real C64 (watching demos, playing games etc.)
* being used as an ONLINE web version to stream emulator content (listening music, watching demos etc.), please refer to the demo page
* being used as an OFFLINE web version to launch emulator content inside the browser (listening music, watching demos etc.), please refer to the demo page

== User Guide
Please read manual here:
<<UserGuide.ad#UserGuide,JSIDPlay2 User Guide>>

== Minimum System Requirement

Java is required and must be installed separately. You can choose to install OpenJDK or as an alternative Oracle Java
|===
| *Platform*        | *OpenJDK Java* | *Oracle Java*
| Windows/Linux/MacOSX   | link:https://adoptium.net[https://adoptium.net^] | link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/^]
|===

== Java version compatibility

You can choose OpenJDK or Oracle Java 17 or never.

Or as an alternative, 
JSIDPlay2 source code is still downward compatible to the Java 8 API.
This being said, you can use JSIDPlay2 using Oracle Java 8 and separate start scripts with *java8* in its name.
This works only with Oracle Java 8, because JavaFX is built-in and my bundled JavaFX libraries are ignored.
In OpenJDK 8 JavaFX is NOT built-in, that will not work, unfortunately.

JSIDPlay2 has been tested and is compatible with Oracle Java 8, OpenJDK 17 and OpenJDK 21.

My recommendation is to use the latest Java version and if this is not possible, than fallback to Oracle Java 8

== Official Releases

link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsidplay2/files/[Official releases^] are more stable, but maybe outdated.
If you require the latest bug fixes or features, please use the latest beta version below.
