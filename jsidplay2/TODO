TODO:
=====

-  I'd like to request a new feature: an option that would switch between the 1,2...11 ordering and
  the current default 3,4...11,1,2 ordering of the subsongs.
- Test classes seem not always to work with JDK17.
- Playlists are wanted to be shared online
- the ability to have music playback occur alongside your SID dump feature. This would look a bit like a tracker,
  and would allow a listener to see the connections between register values and sounds.
- Drag and Drop of HVSC zip file
- Support SIDBlaster reads (for configuru and fpgasid)
- SID Reg should report reads as well.

HTML Client app:
- Search collections
- Export playlists
- show current number of videos in parallel
