- Batch mode for ConsolePlayer to record a whole directory is desired
- for ConsolePlayer unknown parameters should be denied
- Which filters are currently used by the Player, be more talkative to the user.
- What to do to use your own filter, this is totally unclear to the user
- Test classes seem not always to work with JDK17.
- Playlists are wanted to be shared online
- the ability to have music playback occur alongside your SID dump feature. This would look a bit like a tracker,
  and would allow a listener to see the connections between register values and sounds.
- Drag and Drop of HVSC zip file
- Support SIDBlaster reads (for configuru and fpgasid)
- SID Reg should report reads as well.
- freely configurable filter definitions
- Support of executable .command files on MACOSX
