- Playlists are wanted to be shared online
- the ability to have music playback occur alongside your SID dump feature. This would look a bit like a tracker,
  and would allow a listener to see the connections between register values and sounds.
- Drag and Drop of HVSC zip file
- Support SIDBlaster reads (for configuru and fpgasid)
- SID Reg should report reads as well.
